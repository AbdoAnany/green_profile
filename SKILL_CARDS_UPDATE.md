# Skill Cards Update

## Changes Made

### Removed Perspective Effect
- Eliminated the 3D perspective effect from skill cards for a cleaner, more modern design
- Removed the following CSS properties:
  - `perspective: 800px`
  - `transformStyle: preserve-3d`
  - Removed hover rotation effects (`hover:rotate-y-3 hover:rotate-x-5`)

### Increased Card Width
- Changed the grid layout from 4 columns to 3 columns for wider cards
  - Modified: `lg:grid-cols-4` â†’ `lg:grid-cols-3` 
- Increased container width from `max-w-6xl` to `max-w-7xl`
- Added padding inside the card content (p-2) for better spacing
- Added explicit width classes for better responsiveness:
  - Added `w-full` to ensure cards take full width of their grid cell

### Improved Content Display
- Increased padding inside skill cards for better content spacing
- Removed progress bars completely for a cleaner, more focused display
- Maintained all existing animation and hover effects that don't rely on 3D transforms

### Documentation Updates
- Updated SKILLS_UI_ENHANCEMENT.md to reflect the removal of 3D effects
- Modified sections on design principles to emphasize clarity over 3D effects
